          From a young age, I have always been{" "}
          <b>captivated by the world of games and websites</b>. The thrill of
          adventure in games, the strategic challenges, and the immersive
          stories have fascinated me, fueling my imagination and creativity. At
          the same time, the elegance and functionality of well-designed
          websites have inspired me, showing me the power of technology in
          connecting people and sharing information.
          <br />
          <br />
          As I grew older, this passion evolved into a{" "}
          <b> dream to one day create my own games and websites</b>, worlds
          where users could experience the same excitement and joy that I have
          felt. With a strong foundation in <b>computer science</b>, and a rich
          background in various <b>programming languages</b> and{" "}
          <b>frameworks</b>, I am eager to turn this dream into reality,
          bringing innovative and engaging digital experiences to life.

            {" "}
            currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and
            Design{" "}
          </b>{" "}
          at the <b> Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) </b>.
          My education has provided a comprehensive foundation in both
          theoretical and practical aspects of computer science and design,
          allowing me to develop a diverse set of technical skills and gain
          hands-on experience through various projects.
          <br />
          <br />
          During my time at SUTD, I have worked on several significant projects
          that have sharpened my technical abilities. For instance, I developed
          a full-stack Android application called <b>LeftoverChef</b> using{" "}
          <b>Java and XML</b> to reduce food wastage by suggesting recipes for
          leftover ingredients. This project involved implementing advanced
          photo analysis capabilities and ingredient recognition using{" "}
          <b>YoloV5 and TensorFlow</b>, and integrating OpenAI and Google Search
          APIs to generate recipe suggestions. The backend was powered by{" "}
          <b>Firebase</b>, ensuring real-time data storage and retrieval, and
          the development was managed with Git for version control and teamwork.
          This project earned an <b>Honorable Mention and a $1,000 prize</b> at
          the Singtel Information Systems and Programming Merit Award for
          innovative use of technology in combating food waste.
          <br />
          <br />
          These projects, along with my coursework, have equipped me with
          proficiency in{" "}
          <b>
            {" "}
            programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby,
            Java, and C{" "}
          </b>
          . I am also skilled in using <b> databases like SQL and MongoDB</b>,
          and <b>libraries such as Pandas and NumPy </b>. Additionally, I have
          experience with{" "}
          <b>
            frameworks and tools such as Rails, ExpressJS, ReactJS, Bootstrap,
            and TailwindCSS
          </b>
          . My experience with tools like <b>Google Cloud, and Git </b> has also
          further enhanced my ability to tackle complex challenges in the tech
          industry.

          Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I am passionate
          about <b>traveling</b> and <b>photography</b>. I love exploring new
          places, particularly countries renowned for their scenic beauty such
          as <b>Iceland, New Zealand, Switzerland,</b> and <b>Japan</b>.
          Capturing the essence of these breathtaking landscapes through my
          camera lens is a hobby that brings me immense joy and satisfaction.
          <br />
          <br />
          Traveling allows me to immerse myself in different cultures,
          experience diverse environments, and witness the natural wonders of
          the world. My photography focuses on both the stunning sceneries and
          candid moments, including self-portraits that reflect my adventures.
          Whether itâ€™s the dramatic volcanic landscapes of Iceland, the serene
          lakes and mountains of Switzerland, or the vibrant cities and tranquil
          temples of Japan, each destination provides unique opportunities for
          creative expression through photography.
